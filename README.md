# ROSE-Conversational-AI-
A conversational assistant focused on gender fair conversation and unconscious bias determination and empathetic user experience.

## Inspiration
In daily life, we encounter several incidence which may include gender based bias, racisms, body shamming and other bias. Most of the time the bias are not known to us. Its sometimes so engraved into society that those stereotype became part of normal conversation. These are unconscious bias that may exist without the awareness of the person. These unconscious bias hinders the workflow and workspace spirit leading to discriminative activities and understandings. Its very necessary addressed these bias and diminish them by inclusive actions.

## What it does
ROSE is a masculine voiced assistant. It ensures the conversation is gender neutral and all inclusive. It provides the user a empathetic conversational experience. It provides riddles that are meant to normalize the rare, that is defined in our society.

## How we built it
Used Google Dialogflow NLP and Google actions for the settings and other arrangements.

## Challenges we ran into
It was our first time using Google cloud platform. We never used and build something using dialogflow and google actions. We had some difficulties but we fixed it.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
Maximum Assistants are female voiced and this is also a stereotype that a assistant in real or virtual world is always a female character. By including a male voiced empathetic conversational character we tried to include this in normal every day conversations. Also we never used the services, so we did justice as a first time user.

### What we learned
Google Cloud service and json launguage.

## What's next for ROSE
We plan make ROSE multi-linguistic.
We plan to use sentiment analysis for sentiment recognitions.
We also plan to include diverse discussions and conversations as intents and entities to make it more diverse and vibrant.
